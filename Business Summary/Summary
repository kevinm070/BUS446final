We set out to find out what influences the amount of wins a driver has during the season based on data from SCORE sports data.

We hypothesized that leading laps would be a big factor in winning.

The first thing that was tested was what factors have the highest correlation to Win.
We found the correlation of the different variables to Win using RStudio then made a bar chart to help visualize our findings.
Clearly, laps led, percent laps lead and num fastest laps were the most correlated to Win, meaning that the driver posting the fastest lap of race most often during a season and leading the most laps 
during the season is more likely to have multiple wins during the season.

The next thing tested was the relationship between average starting position and wins per season. We made a scatter plot with the avg start as the x and wins as y and found a negative linear 
relationship between the two. That means the drivers starting closer to the front (smaller x number) have more wins than those starting towards the back.

The final thing tested was laps led vs average finish. Based on the scatter plot, laps led as the x and avg finish as the y produces a negative linear relationship, 
meaning leading more laps probably leads to more wins.

In conclusion, the drivers leading the most laps during a season, starting closer to the front and posting the fastest laps of the race will have more wins than the drivers that don't.
